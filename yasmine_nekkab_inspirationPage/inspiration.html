        <h1>Yasmine Nekkab's Art Inspiration Board</h1>
        <h2> Sara M. Dalla Pozza - <em>Illustrator</em></h2>

        <p>An artist I always use as reference when drawing is synesthesia.fear on Instagram. Her art inspires me because each of her illustrations has a fun and dreamlike pose and tells an interesting story. My most favorite part of her art style is that it is semi-realistic in proportion and uses painting techniques for rendering, but still remains flat, simple, and cartoony. When you look at the details you notice how many technical skills she possesses in anatomy and realism while it still looks like a 2D cartoon. It encourages me to only shade and place lighting where it needs to be and not overcomplicate things or overblend.</p>
        <h2>Billie Eilish - <em>Musical Artist</em></h2>

        <p>This is a rather basic pick but I just appreciate how much of the process of music production she shares through interviews. I like that she's not just a singer but she also knows how to produce the music by doing it alongside her brother. She breaks down the mental anguish of putting together albums and explains how certain tracks were made or how they came up with it. Though she's talking about producing music and writing lyrics, I can relate so much to the artistic process she talks about and the art block when it comes to me creating my illustrations and animations. It's nothing new for a singer to know about all aspects of music or to talk about it, but I really like that many of her interviews focus on artistry rather than accidentally caring about some celebrity who does whatever with their life. Aside from this, the music itself just aligns with many of my tastes like a cute song with depressing lyrics or some pretty and jazzy vocals. It inspires me most in creating original stories and characters that are from my own mind and experiences rather than doing fan art.</p>
        <h2>Crisppyboat - <em>3D Artist</em></h2>

       <p>The artist crisppyboat creates 3D models, scenes, and animations that resemble something you’d make out of play doh. I think it’s such an adorable way to approach 3D modeling and makes it seem like there’s freedom in form rather than creating a stiff model. Every image is action packed and the color palettes are very notable and I feel that I would know that it’s them just based on the colors. It makes me want to 3D model some more and helps me to believe that I am not limited in what a model is meant to be structurally. They are so original and distinct that you wonder what you could come up with yourself.</p>
