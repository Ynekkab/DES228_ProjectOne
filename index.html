            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Yasmine, also known as Yami, is currently an undergraduate at San Francisco State University majoring in Visual Communication and minoring in Animation. Currently, her big project is directing and animating a short thesis film to complete the Animation Minor. You can check out her previous work through the portfolio link. For any inquiries, her email is listed above as well.</p>

            <div  class="bodyContent">
            <p id="bodyParagraph">Aside from school work, Yasmine creates digital artwork of characters and has done multiple character animation clips. The artwork varies from fan art of various animated characters to original character designs. She has also taken commissions and participated in Art Fight; an art challenge where you create art of a fellow artist's original character and receive some in return. The art can vary from drawings to animations. The animations on this page are some of her Art Fight submissions.</p>

            <p>Yasmine began drawing at a young age and started doing digital art at 10 years old. She wanted to work for Pixar Animation Studios. But after viewing dozens of Cartoon Network shows she realized she preferred TV animation. Knowing that itâ€™s a risky industry, she started out as a Computer Science major but found that there was no creativity, just code. After searching for days, she found Visual Communications which is a great combination of visual arts and coding.</p>

            <p id="bodyParagraph">But, animation remained her main passion. She has skills in multiple areas in animation. She can do character design, character animation, storyboarding, backgrounds, writing, and directing. Working through the animation minor, she has found that her main passion lies in the visual development stage. SO her ideal animation job would be to become an art director.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Her plans for the future are to submit her animation thesis to multiple film festivals. The big goal is to release an indie animation series, which has been in development since 2021. You can keep an eye out for an eventual pilot and hopefully the series will come to life in years to come.</p>
