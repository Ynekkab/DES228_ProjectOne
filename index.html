       <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p>I'm a fourth year student at San Francisco State University majoring in Visual Communication and minoring in Animaton. I'm also an officer of the Animation Society
        <br> here at the school. I've been doing digital art for 10+ years and currently specialize in 2D character animation. I've done a lot of fanart of cartoons I enjoy
        <br> but am now focusing on making more original characters. I'm into various media like cartoons made by Cartoon Network or Disney TV Animation. 
        <br> But I also keep up with plenty others including indie animations. With video games, I don't play much but when I do it's Guilty Gear Strive or Fortnite. 
        <br> I would love to do design and animation for film and video games in the future. Aside from the visual arts, I'm also getting into music and hoping to 
        <br> practice the piano. I've also been meaning to get back into roller skating.</p>
