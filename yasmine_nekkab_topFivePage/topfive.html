       <h1>My Top 5 Favorite Animated Series</h1>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Adventure Time</strong>
            <br>
            <img src="img/adventuretime.png" alt="Adventure Time is written in red as a sword goes through the word time.">
            <br>
            <p>I believe Adventure Time has some of the most creative world building 
                <br> and even though things do get serious, it maintains a soft and playful 
                <br> tone throughout the series.</p>
            <p>You can stream this show on <a href="https://www.max.com/shows/adventure-time/fff09eaf-17c3-446b-be32-8a0d47e4ccf1">Max</a>!</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Amphibia</strong>
            <br>
            <img src="img/amphibia.png" alt="Amphibia is written in green with a mushroom growing out of the letter i.">
            <br>
            <p>Amphibia was a pleasant surprise when watching the first time. 
                <br> It goes from a silly concept of a girl in a frog world to having a crazy 
                <br> conflict between her 2 best friends while facing a war between amphibians. 
                <br> The art style seems simple but can get so mesmerizing when animated!</p>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Steven Universe</strong>
            <br>
            <img src="img/stevenuniverse.png" alt="Steven Universe is written in block lettering using yellows, oranges, and purple.">
            <br>
            <p>This show can be an emotional rollercoaster at times but has such a pretty
                <br> format in storytelling and design. There is foreshadowing dating back to the 
                <br> first episodes and I always stumble upon a new one every rewatch. It has a 
                <br> bunch of songs that continue to stick with me and a beautiful aesthetic.</p>
            <p>You can stream this show on <a href="https://www.max.com/ai/en/shows/steven-universe/eb66748d-f7f2-458a-aa7b-488e2fb8bef1">Max</a>!</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gravity Falls</strong>
            <br>
            <img src="img/gravityfalls.png" alt="Gravity Falls is written in  block lettering in the colors green and orange.">
            <br>
            <p>Gravity Falls is a mystery based show where you can find foreshadowing
                <br> and secret codes in almost every episode. It never fails to keep you guessing
                <br> and wanting for more. It also has some of the funniest jokes that still continue 
                <br> to make me laugh!</p>

        </li>
        <li><strong>The Owl House</strong>
            <br>
            <img src="img/theowlhouse.png" alt="The Owl House is written in gold with an owl symbol placed inside of the letter O.">
            <br>
            <p>This show had a strong beginning and a very cool concept about a human girl wanting to
                <br>  be a witch. The art style is my favorite out of these and the characters
                <br> progress in very different ways than where they started. Unfortunately, this show
                <br> had to face a very abrupt cut in it's final season and didn't end properly.</p>
