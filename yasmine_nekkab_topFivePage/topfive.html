            <h1>My Top 5 Favorite Cartoons</h1>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Adventure Time</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/adventuretime.png" alt="Adventure Time is written in red as a sword goes through the word time.">
                    <br>
                    <p>I believe Adventure Time has some of the most creative world building and even though things do get serious, it maintains a soft and playful tone throughout the series. There are dozens of characters to love and the story is also one of the most well-written. For animation fanatics, I would say this is a must watch!</p>
                    <p>You can stream this show on <a href="https://www.max.com/shows/adventure-time/fff09eaf-17c3-446b-be32-8a0d47e4ccf1">Max</a>!</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Amphibia</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/amphibia.png" alt="Amphibia is written in green with a mushroom growing out of the letter i.">
                    <br>
                    <p>Amphibia was a pleasant surprise when watching the first time. It goes from a silly concept of a girl in a frog world to having a crazy conflict between her 2 best friends while facing a war between amphibians. The art style seems simple but can get so mesmerizing when animated! This show has an amazing finale and makes so many pop culture references.</p>
                    <p>You can stream this show on <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/amphibia/4jsQ0zDkUTeN">Disney Plus</a>!</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Steven Universe</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/stevenuniverse.png" alt="Steven Universe is written in block lettering using yellows, oranges, and purple.">
                    <br>
                    <p>This show can be an emotional rollercoaster at times but has such a pretty format in storytelling and design. There is foreshadowing dating back to the first episodes and I always stumble upon a new detail every rewatch. It also has a bunch of songs that continue to stick with me and a beautiful aesthetic.</p>
                    <p>You can stream this show on <a href="https://www.max.com/ai/en/shows/steven-universe/eb66748d-f7f2-458a-aa7b-488e2fb8bef1">Max</a>!</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Gravity Falls</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/gravityfalls.png" alt="Gravity Falls is written in  block lettering in the colors green and orange.">
                    <br>
                    <p>Gravity Falls is a mystery based show where you can find foreshadowing and secret codes in almost every episode. It never fails to keep you guessing and wanting for more. It also has some of the funniest jokes that still continue to make me laugh!</p>
                    <p>You can stream this show on <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/gravity-falls/HZxayxzMJqed">Disney Plus</a>!</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Owl House</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/theowlhouse.png" alt="The Owl House is written in gold with an owl symbol placed inside of the letter O.">
                    <br>
                    <p>This show had a strong beginning and a very cool concept about a human girl wanting to be a witch. The art style is my favorite out of these and the characters progress in very different ways than where they started. Unfortunately, this show had to face a very abrupt cut in it's final season and didn't end properly. So despite having a great concept, she's at the bottom for me.</p>
